# DynamicMasking
A dynamic masking Matlab app for generation of masks for PIV where the camera/model are moving.

This Matlab app was developed using Matlab 2021a. It enables the use of ReadIMX to read multi-frame images from LaVision. 
Forks/push requests are welcome to improve compatibility with other PIV system providers [which currently are not implemented].

Please cite "A continuously scanning spatiotemporally averaging method for obtaining volumetric mean flow measurements with stereoscopic PIV" by Fernando Zigunov et. al. (2022)
